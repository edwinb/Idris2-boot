1/1: Building Total (Total.idr)
Main> :total count
Main.count is total
Main> :total badCount
Main.badCount is possibly not terminating due to recursive path Main.badCount -> Prelude.Functor implementation at Prelude.idr:1004:1--1009:1 -> Prelude.map
Main> :total process
Main.process is total
Main> :total badProcess
Main.badProcess is possibly not terminating due to recursive path Main.badProcess -> Main.badProcess -> Main.badProcess
Main> :total doubleInt
Main.doubleInt is total
Main> :total main
Main.main is total
Main> :q
Bye for now!
