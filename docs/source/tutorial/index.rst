A Crash Course in Idris 2
#########################

This is a crash course in Idris 2 (sort of a tutorial, but rather less
gentle I'm afraid!).
It provides a brief introduction to programming in the Idris Language.
It covers the core language features, assuming some experience with an
existing functional programming language such as Haskell or OCaml.

This has been revised and updated from the Idris 1 tutorial. For details of
changes since Idris 1, see :ref:`updates-index`.
