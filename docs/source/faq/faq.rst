Can Idris 2 compile itself?
===========================

Not yet. Although it is written in Idris, there are several changes to the
language which are not fully backwards compatible (see Section
:ref:`updates-index`) so, although we hope to get there fairly soon - especially
since we are resisting using any of the more sophisticated language features -
it's not automatically the case that it will be able to compile itself.
