Idris 2 is designed to support multiple code generators. The default target is
Chez Scheme, with a Racket code generator also supported. However, the
intention is, as with Idris 1, to support multiple targets on multiple platforms,
including e.g. JavaScript, JVM, .NET, and others yet to be invented.
This makes the design of a foreign function interface (FFI), which calls
functions in other languages, a little challenging, since ideally it will
support all possible targets!

To this end, the Idris 2 FFI aims to be flexible and adaptable, while still
supporting most common requirements without too much need for "glue" code in
the foreign language.
